# renarration-code-comprehension
This project is focusing on renarration of code. The project falls under the domain of code comprehension.  Our assumption is that a Maintenance Engineer is having to look at some code that is accessible on the web. 
 + How does this maint. engineer make sense of what has been written sometime ago by some other author? 
 + How to enable better code comprehension?  
 
Our strategy is to use renarration as a mechanism to enable code comprehension. 
 
We will develop this project as a Sweet Based renarration application. The development will be done in several releases r0, r1, r2...   

##Overall Project goal##
Enable better project comprehension. Aim is to assist a code maintenance engineer better comprehend earlier developed and often poorly documented code.
